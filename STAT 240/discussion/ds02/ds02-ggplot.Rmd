## Exoplanet Data

We will be working with data on exoplanets; exoplanets are planets orbiting stars outside our Solar System.  The data were pulled from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html) on September 12, 2022.

```{r read-data, echo = FALSE}
## Read in the csv file using read_csv()

## Note: the raw file begins with a block of comment codes which begin with the character #
## We can use the argument comment=# inside of read_csv() to delete form each input row any characters from # through the end of the line
## The only trouble is that there is a variable disc_refname which is a URL and some of the URL values include a #.
## Each of these rows is then corrupted as all columns after are treated as a comment
## A dirty fix is to use skip=124 instead to skip the first 124 rows of the data set
## This works for this data set, but the solution is not robust as a future form of the data may change the preface to the data and use a different number of comment rows before the actual data begins
## In fact, last year, we skipped 100 rows, not 124.
## Here, we use the skip=124 solution and hope to find a more robust solution in the future

## The data set contains one row per confirmed exoplanet
## The raw data has over 33,000 rows and 121 variables
## We are only interested in a few variables and use some dplyr code to select a few of these variables
## Also, the default names are not so nice to work with so we rename them.
## For this assignment, we drop rows with missing data so the only remaining exoplanets have both a mass and a radius

## This code fails to read in all the valid data due to some rows with # in the variable disc_refname or another containing a URL
#planets = read_csv("../../data/exoplanet-confirmed_2022-09-12.csv",comment="#") %>%

## Use this instead
## Note that the drop_na() command reduces the data set to just over 1000 cases

planets = read_csv("../../data/exoplanet-confirmed_2022-09-12.csv", skip=124) %>%  
  filter(default_flag == 1) %>% ## pick a single row for each unique exoplanet
  select(pl_name, discoverymethod, disc_year, sy_pnum, pl_rade, pl_bmasse) %>%
  rename(planet = pl_name,
         method = discoverymethod,
         year = disc_year,
         number = sy_pnum,
         radius = pl_rade,
         mass = pl_bmasse) %>%
  drop_na()
```

The variables we will be working with are defined below.  If you want more details, please see the exoplanet archive [data column definitions](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_PS_columns.html) (using the column names in the raw data).

`planet` = Planet Name
`method` =  Method by which the planet was first identified
`year` = Discovery Year (the year it was discovered)
`number` = Number of Planets
`radius` = Planet Radius (units: Earth Radius)
`mass` = Approximate or Minimum Planet Mass (units: Earth Mass)



## Questions

**Note:** `error=TRUE` has been added to the setup chunk near the top of the document. This will enable the document to knit EVEN IF there are errors. Make sure to check your knitted output carefully for errors before submitting!

### Question 1

> Make a scatter plot with `radius` (the estimate of the planet radius) on the x-axis and `mass` (the estimate of the planet mass) on the vertical axis.  The `scale_y_log10()` and `scale_y_log10()` are added to change the axis values to a `log10()` scale.

```{r question-1}
ggplot(planets, aes(x = radius, y = mass)) + geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() + scale_x_log10() +
  xlab("Radius (earth radius)") + ylab("Mass (earth mass)") +
  ggtitle("Exoplanets mass vs. radius", 
          subtitle="Using NASA exoplanet archive data")
```



### Question 2

> Make a scatter plot like the previous problem, but add the `color` aesthetic inside the `aes()` function and set it equal to `method` (discovery method). This will color each point according to which method was used to discover it.

```{r question-2}
ggplot(planets, aes(x = radius, y = mass, color = method)) + geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() + scale_x_log10() +
  xlab("Radius (earth radius)") + ylab("Mass (earth mass)") +
  ggtitle("Exoplanets mass vs. radius", 
          subtitle="Using NASA explanet archive data")
```



### Question 3

> Make a barplot counting how many planets were discovered using each method. (Hint: use `geom_bar()`, which counts the number of occurences, unlike `geom_col()`).

```{r}
ggplot(planets, aes(x = method)) + geom_bar() +
  xlab("Method") + ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Number of discoveries by method", 
          subtitle="Using NASA exoplanet archive data")
```



### Question 4

- Which discovery method was used to detect the most exoplanets in our `planet` data frame?

Transit method was used to detect the most exoplanets in our `planet` data frame.

- What general pattern do you notice between planet mass and radius?

From the scatter plot, there is likely a positive correlation between mass and radius; as the radius of an exoplanet increases, its mass tends to increase as well.

- What is the estimated radius (approximately) of the most massive planet included on the plot?

Approximately 13 earth radius is the radius of the most massive planet on the plot.

### Question 5

Make a histogram showing the distribution of the base-10 log of the masses in the dataset. Note you can do this by setting `log10(mass)` as the `x` aesthetic inside `aes()`. Pick a nice `fill` and `color` for the histogram. Looking at the plot visually, what's the approximate mean log mass?

```{r}
ggplot(planets, aes(x = log10(mass))) + geom_histogram(fill = "pink", color = "black", binwidth = 0.1) +
  xlab("Log(Mass) (log10(earth mass))") + ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of log masses of exoplanets", 
          subtitle="Using NASA exoplanet archive data")
```
