## Questions

### Question 1

Type `getwd()` in the Console and verify that you see that the working directory is set to be `ds01`.
If not, learn how to set the working directory from someone in your group or the TA.

```{r getwd, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
getwd()
```

### Question 2

The following R chunk will read the data.
The `names()` command will print the names of the variables in the data frame.

Replace the text XXX below with the correct numbers.

```{r read-data}
## Note:  The path to the data set was updated to the location of the data file
mendota = read_csv("../../data/lake-mendota-winters-2022.csv")
print(mendota)
names(mendota)
```


#### Response

The Lake Mendota data set has 7 variables (indicate the number of variables) and the first variable (next to the `[1]`) is named winter.


## Submission

Once you have completed all of the questions, knit the document.
This should create an HTML document in your `ds01` folder.

Go to the Canvas course web page, find the Assignments section in the left panel, and upload both your edited Rmd and output HTML files.
